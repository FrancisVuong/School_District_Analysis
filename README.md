# Written Report for the School District Analysis

## Overview of of the school district analysis

### Purpose

- The purpose of this project was to find and correct some errors commited by Thomas High School, data found in the module leading up to this challenge assignment shows evidence of academic dishonesty. We are replacing the data math and reading scores for Thomas High School specificially for the ninth grade. After we are repeating our analysis and reporting again on how these changes affected the overall data.

## Analysis and Challenges

- First we inputed our raw data through the use of the csv files we gathered through the module(first analysis).
- We then cleaned and inspected the data, then proceeded to correct the inappropriate data. 
- Merging the the new correct data set to the school data set we are able to gather more information for our new dataFrame. 
- With the newly formed dataFrame we are able to perform the necessary calculations for the correct metrics and visualize the data with tables. 
### Analysis of Outcomes 

- There are noticable changes to the data after the changes. 
- Mainly the drastic decrease in averages for the Thomas High School data presented after the changes were applied. 
- Thomas High School's averages went from the bottom 5 performing schools to the top 5.  


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

- The main challenges I faced throughout this challenge was mostly to do with syntax errors and finding the errors in the code I did earlier in the file. 
- The volume of code required was also somewhat daunting to type out, although much of the frame work was given in the sample code file provided, I had to modify much of it to actually work with the dataFrames I had manage to create for the first delieverable. 

## Results

- After Removing the ninth grade math and reading scores from Thomas High School, it affects the summary tables slightly. However the percentage passing rate for both math and reading has greatly decreased.
